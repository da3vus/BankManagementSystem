Hi! This is a Bank Management System I developed in C.
Here are the features:

- Login screen on startup where users can login or sign up with ID and password.
- Main menu screen that displays every operation the user can do to their account.
- Operations include:
  - Deposit/withdraw money from the account
  - Edit their account ID or password
  - Display account information/view profile
  - Delete account
  - Logout

- There is a text file called "userInfo" that will store account information for
each user including ID, password, and account balance. There are already 3 accounts in it.
